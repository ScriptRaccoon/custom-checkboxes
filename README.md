# Custom Checkboxes

This is a small illustration how to create custom checkboxes. It is based on the article [Pure CSS Custom Checkbox Style](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/) by Stephanie Eckles (with minor modifications). The checkbox size and color is inherited from the parent.
